# typographic-grid
The 'Typographic Grid Wizard' is a script for Scribus that generates a grid of guides where the cells follow the baseline grid. You can use this script on a master page and then apply it to other pages. Input parameters are: margins and gutters in baseline units, number of columns and rows and desired leading in points. The top and bottom margins are adapted with trial and error until the result fits. Then you are proposed to draw the guides.
See the 'Instructions.pdf'-file for more information.
